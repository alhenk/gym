Project "Gym" was created for HIC class.

Design brief: Change.

We are very determined at the beginning of our decision to do physical exercises,
then we are losing motivation and getting less determined.

With exercise tracking system, we can immediately commit the amount of workout (push-up, pull-up, sit-up counts)
and follow personal progress to keep motivation for Change.

On the other hand...
We can find the other way to keep motivation.

The main frame of the project (ROR) is from the other Coursera class "SAAS"
